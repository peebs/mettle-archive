Richcoin Competition
=========

This is a portion of the code written for a Cloud Computing class at UCSB in Spring 2014. The coinstealer code was the
part that won the backward mining race and the rest of the code was mostly created after so that we could distribute
foward-searchers amoung many cloud nodes. The forward searcher coordination worked, but no significan't progress was
made on Ramsey 6,6.
